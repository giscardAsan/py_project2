                <p><span>This data is processed for the purposes of enabling the use of the website (establishing a connection), system security, technical administration, network infrastructure and the optimization of the online offer. This data cannot be attributed to specific persons, and will not be merged with other data sources without consent. The data will also be deleted after a statistical evaluation.</span></p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h3><span>3. Collection, processing and use of personal data</span></h3>
                During data processing, your interests that require protection are always taken into account in accordance with the legal provisions. Personal data (such as your name or email address) is only collected if you provide it to us voluntarily. This may be the case, for example:
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <ul class="list">
                    <li aria-level="1"><span>when you make a contact request</span></li>
                    <li  aria-level="1"><span>when you register for a MOVIEgaiN account (MOVIEgaiN Pro)</span></li>
                    <li aria-level="1"><span>when you leave feedback via our forms</span></li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    We use the data you provide without your specific consent exclusively to process your request and delete it when the process is complete and legal regulations do not prevent deletion.

  <h3><span>4. Use of functional cookies</span></h3>
  We use so-called cookies to make your visit to our website comfortable and to enable the use of certain functions. Cookies are small text files that are used as identifiers. We transfer them to the hard drive of your computer via your web browser and can read them during your current visit (so-called session cookies). Please note that certain cookies are already stored as soon as you enter our website. Our cookies are protected against being read by third parties by means of your browser’s security standards.

  <h3><span>5. Interest-based advertising</span></h3>
We would like to suggest the movies that best suit your personal taste and show you where you can watch them. What we do, provided you have given us your consent: to personalize your experience, we collect, process and store your interactions with our website. This allows us to send you tailored or interest-based advertisements that are optimized for your profile. These ads may be displayed on MOVIEgaiN as well as on other websites you visit or apps you use (using retargeting technology). They may also be delivered in emails. If you do not give your consent, we will still show you ads on our website, but they will not be personalized.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
In general, all your data is collected in anonymized or pseudonymized form, but we may also collect personal data for explicitly defined use cases. Subject to your consent, we process certain data with the help of third parties and share your data with our business partners. More details on this can be found below. When you use our mobile app, we may collect your GPS location, subject to your additional consent. We may look at how often you use the app and where you downloaded it.
